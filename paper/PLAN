OK 1. Explain why our approach is better than that of the Boyer-Moore Proof.
      ... because we formulate the correctness criteria as an abstract 
      machine, which is more abstract than the invariant referring to
      particular internal locations in the code.

      We also formalize refinement mappings.

OK 2. Compare with the UNITY proof

OK 3. Give an informal argument

   4. Russinoffs counter example

Ok 5. Give the specification its own chapter.

OK 6. Explain that you don't get rid of invariant generation

OK 7. Refer to the BRP protocol
