Klaus:
  I might've overlooked a few things but I hope they
won't be too disruptive to the reader.  I'll fix it
and place it on the PVS web page.
  I won't have very much time to deal with the tech report
since I have several other hard deadlines staring at me.
The best I can do is do some light editing.  Would you have some
time to incorporate some of the text from the short paper
into the tech report?  In general, I find your writing
quite agreeable but don't always agree with your choice of
notation and your LaTeX style.  A few suggestions:
 1. Use "foo~\ref{bar}" instead of "foo \ref{bar}"
 2. Leave 2 spaces after a period otherwise LaTeX thinks
    it's an abbreviation.
 3. Use \@. for a period preceded by LaTeX stuff otherwise
    it gets similarly confused.
 4. Use ``...'' instead of "...".
 5.  Try to use a special font (math or tt) for notation.

On new things: From reading/editing the short paper, I realized
that I'd like to continue looking at concurrent protocols.
Find other examples where abstraction is effective, show how
abstractions can be computed via abstract interpretation,
and combine all this with compositionality.  I think this
dovetails with your agenda.

Cheers,
Shankar
