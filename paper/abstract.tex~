\begin{abstract}
  
  We describe how the PVS verification system  has been used to verify
  a  safety  property of a widely studied garbage collection  algorithm.
  The safety property  asserts  that    ``nothing  but garbage  is    ever
  collected.''  The garbage  collection algorithm and  its composition
  with  the user program can be regarded  as a concurrent  system with two
  processes working on  a shared memory.   Such concurrent systems are
  encoded in  PVS as state transition systems using a
  model similar to TLA~\cite{TLA:TOPLAS94}.  The  safety  criterion is
  formulated  as a 
  refinement and proved  using  refinement  mappings.    
  Russinoff~\cite{Rus:GC}  has    verified the algorithm   in  the Boyer-Moore
  prover, but his proof is not  based on refinement and 
  safety property  cannot be appreciated  without a  glass box view of
  the   workings of the algorithm.    Using
  refinement, however,  the safety criterion makes sense independent of
  the garbage collection algorithm.   As a by-product, we encode  a
  slightly modified version of Lamport's refinement mappings in PVS.
